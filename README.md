## PSD2 Standards

PSD2 should cover Accounts and Payment related services within the retail bank environment, and security aspects. It does not cover additional retail or capital market products or provides a mechanism to include these at a later stage. The interpretation of the outlined requirements of the EU legislation varies in the EU countries.

### Account & Payment Services
- Account Information Services
- Payment Initiation Services

### Security
- Customer Authentication & Security 

### Third Party Access
- Access to accounts (XS2A)

In some EU countries this is understood as a separate topic.

## Industrie Payment Standard - worldwide usage

- W3C Payments

## PSD2-Standards - European Union (EU) legislation

- STET
- POLAND API
- UK Open Banking API
- Slovak Banking API
- OpenID FAPI

## Frameworks - European Union

- Berlin Group NG

Both global standards are Open Source Open Banking API Standards, and actively work with the industry and regulator alike but are not defined by the regulator, as it is the case with the current PSD2 standards. 

One Standard (W3C Payments) is a pure (nonfinancial) industry payment standard. 

The mentioned Payment & Accounts Framework is a (non-public) private club of financial market participants with the objective to find an acceptable and common ground between all parties. Communication is limited to closed circle dialogs, publications are limited to one webpage.
As the word framework suggests, it has interpretation room, and so fare provided API information (e.g. YAML v1.3) questions the capability to achieve this goal (number of errors, completeness, references to standards used within). Even so, some Non-EU countries consider its implication, but at the moment its difficult to find any binding references.

Please, be aware that each standard mentioned above and framework has an individual Copyright, and should be applied accordingly. All other information provided as stated within the repository is AGPL 2018, 2019.
