Both global standards are Open Source Open Banking API Standards, and activly work with the industrie and regulator alike but are not defined by the regulator, as it is the case with the current PSD2 standards. 

One Standard (W3C Payments) is a pure (non finacial) industrie payment standard. 

The mentioned Payment & Accounts Framework is a (non public) private club of financial market participants with the objective to find an accepatable and common ground between all parties. 

As the word framework suggest it has interpretation room, and so fare provided API informaton (YAML) questions the capability to achieve this goal (number of errors, completnes, references to standards used within). Even so, some Non-EU countries consider its implication, but at the moment its difficult to find any binding references.

Please, be aware that each above mentioned standard and framework has an individual Copyright, and should be applied accordingly. All other information provided as stated within the repository is AGPL 2018, 2019.
