# Slovakia Banking API Standard

The new EU-Council Directive (EU), 2015/2366 on Internal Market Payment Services (PSD2), has created a single legislative framework for the entry of new payment service providers (third parties or Third Party Providers) into the European financial services market. 

## Objectives

New Payment or Third Party providers may, after meeting certain conditions, provide three new types of services to clients of banks:

* account information services (AIS),
* Payment Initiation Services (PIS),
* Payment Instrument Issuer Service (PIIS).

The European Commission, which was the initiator of the PSD2 directive, sought to respond to the ever-increasing rate of innovation in payment services, to increase competition in the market and thus to simplify payments to clients.

The PSD2 Directive was transposed into Slovakia into the Act on Payment Services (492/2009), the amendment of which is valid from 13 January 2018. Based on its requirements that banks from 13 January 2018 must allow communication with third parties in the provision of the relevant services, the Slovak Banking Association decided together with its members to prepare a voluntary standard of communication between banks and third parties in the form of Application Programming Interface (API)

### Slovakia Banking API Standard includes definitions for RPP, ASPSP, PSU

The Standard defines secure communication between the TPP and the ASPSP and between the PSU and the ASPSP, in particular to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data and the identity of the communicating entities.

### Slovakia Banking API Standard does not include for SCA

The Standard does not describe the process of strong authentication of the ASPSP's (PSU) customer's payment service user (SCA) with the ASPSP itself. The SCA process drawn in the process flow of the individual processes diagrams serves for demonstration purposes and a better understanding of process flow. The SCA process is not part of this standard.

## When is it binding - Entry into force

The Sloval Banking API Standard enters into force on the date specified in the Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council on payment services in the internal market.
